# Coffee-Chatbot

A simple chatbot that uses pre-defined choices and responses to get your caffeine ordered fast and efficiently!

### Ideas for Improvement:
 - Add iced / hot drink options.
 - Track pricing based on the customer's chosen options.
 - Queue orders in a database to account for processing and fulfillment. (JSON or Replit DB)
 - Add a summary screen with the pricing breakdown / receipt, user's name, order no., and estimate time based on orders in queue at the time of placement.
 -Add ability to exit at anytime using keywords like: 'exit', 'stop', or 'end'.
 - Implement statistic tracking for total number of orders placed, drinks ordered, and revenue accrued.
